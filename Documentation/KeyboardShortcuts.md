Biblelator still only has a few working keyboard shortcuts

Navigation
==========
    Alt+Up  Next verse      From anywhere
    Alt+Dwn Previous verse  From anywhere

Files
=====
    Ctrl+S  Save file       From an edit window


Standard editor shortcuts
=========================
    Ctrl+left       Previous word
    Ctrl+right      Next word


Eventually we hope to make these keyboard shortcuts adjustable by the user.
