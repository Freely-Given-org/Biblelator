Biblelator ToDo List
====================

This is an informal list of things that need to be fixed or are planned to be done.

Eventually we will use the issue tracker at Github
    - actually, you're welcome to list your issues there already.

Things nearer the top of the list are higher in priority.

* Get open resource collection working
* Get the different views working on the edit window
* Work on user stylesheets
* Make a full project properties dialog and do project setting properly
* Add "Recent" entries to the main menus
* Allow the user to set the containing folder for projects and exports
* Consider when the same project/file is opened multiple times
* Consider toolbars in child windows (and/or hiding the menu)
* Handle multiple overlapping tags in the HTML window
* Add "Display by Section" for Bibles that have section headings
    Does that mean we have previous/next section navigation also?
* Autosave edited files
* Design the default short-cut keys for verse/chapter navigation
* Work with someone as a test user
* Work out how the help system will work and start implementing some content
* Improve Sword Bible module display
* Look at doing some windows updates in idle time
* Design an icon
* Release version 0.5
* Improve Strongs (lexicon) HTML display
* Allow handling of non-English DBP resources
* Think more about use of colour for distinguishing windows
* Think more about window arranging
* Make multiple Bible lexicon windows use the same (loaded) lexicon
* Handle interlinear display (for original language resources)
* Investigate integrating more online resources
* Get it usable as a ESFM Bible editor
* Improve the about page(s)
* Learn how to install Biblelator on OS X
* Allow the short-cut keys to be edited within the program
* Get full multiprocessing working
* Add progress bars for slow tasks
* Create an intelligent installer
* Allow for automatic program updates (choice of stable and development branches)
* Release version 1.0 (BibleOrgSys versification systems have to be working first)
* Think more about fonts and writing systems, special Unicode characters, etc.
