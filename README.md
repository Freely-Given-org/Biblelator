Biblelator
==========

A (hackable) multi-window Bible editor written in Python with Tkinter.

See https://Freely-Given.org/Software/Biblelator

Biblelator was used daily by the developer as a production Bible editor for a few years
from February 2016 as an alternative to Paratext for editing Paratext USFM Bible files
(on Ubuntu Linux).
The first alpha release (v0.30) was advertised in mid-March 2016.
Now in 2022, development has restarted again with many more features to come
and many early features to be further extended and polished.

By including the Bible Organisational System (BibleOrgSys), Biblelator is able
to display most unencrypted Bibles that you have on your computer as translation
resources, and is also able to export Bibles into a large number of formats.

No memory or speed optimisations have been applied to make Biblelator run more efficiently yet --
the focus is still on experimentation and adding features.

One very annoying limitation is hard-coded paths for resources such as Hebrew and Greek lexicons.
This will hopefully be addressed by the end of 2022.
